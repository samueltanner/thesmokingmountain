          From my late teens through my mid-20s, I worked for the U.S.
          Geological Survey, Water Resources Division in Tacoma, Washington.
          Luckily, I was involved in many water resource studies after Mount St.
          Helens gigantic eruption in May 1980. My partner, Colleen, and I met
          at the U.S.G.S. One of her fondest memories is performing a water
          chemistry analysis within days of the eruption on the Toutle River
          system, with one foot in the North Fork and one foot in the South.
